I've got special challenge today. I couldn't decline it.

I have to increase my skills in testing and deploying apps using Docker.

First thought - write bookstore app once again. From scratch. Better version, included users app inside. 

So, there you have new [repo](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/bookstore).

For today (day039) I've created git repo, project, apps and db using MySQL Workbench.
