<p>Day051: Today I've started next tutorial to learn Docker.</p>

<p>Day052: Had to start from the bottom, because nothing has crushed. For now, I almost did all tutorial, but now I have to go to work :/</p>

Day053: Solved all problems and finished this tutorial. Moreover, I've created new repo where I'm collecting ```README.md``` examples for future projects.
