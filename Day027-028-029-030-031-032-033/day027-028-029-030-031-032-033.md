On 027 and 028 day I've started new tutorial from TechWithTim just to practise Django framework. I will do this next 2/3 days.

Day029 - doing that tutorial. Today I've created models and migrated them into db, registered apps and created superuser.

Day030 - creted templates and admin dashboard.

Day031 - created simple form, view which creates new lists (using POST response method and csrf token) and template.

Day032 - today I've done some frontend stuff, like sidenav where are links to other pages.

Day033 - did some frontend with bootstrap, created and installed new app -> register. Also created register.html and register function-based view.
