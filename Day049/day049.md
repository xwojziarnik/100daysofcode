Hello!

While I'm stuck with [bookstore](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/bookstore) app and I can't go further I realised that I didn't finish app using Sanic framework, Docker and MongoDB.

So, for now (while I'm trying to do import func in bookstore) I'm doing next app in [repo](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/AsyncRestApi).
