Hi! Last two days I had few problems with connect SQLAlchemy in Pycharm. I tried few solutions, but nothing has worked. 
In the meantime I saw few tutorials using Visual Studio Code, which I decided to use for that app.

So I created second repository and used VSC this time. 

Link to second repo:

And link to freeCodeCamp tutorial:

Have fun, coming back tomorrow!
