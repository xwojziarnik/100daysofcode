<p>Day069: I created a repo, project, app and readme file.</p>
<p>Day070: Today I created first two fbvs and one models. Moreover, I got to know something about Debugger and HttpRequests.</p>
<p>Day071: Today I was working on doing models, migrations and CRUD on database. In the end I've loaded a csv file into new db. Second chapter is done.</p>
<p>Day072: Next chapter - URLs & views. For today - basic fbv for listing all books from db with few informations. Moreover - HTML files.</p>
<p>Day073: Added some inheritance in templates and detail view of books.</p>
<p>Day074: All day fighting with django admin site. Calm start: Crud on users & books. Than one big error while overwriting django admin site.</p>
<p>Day075: Basic changes in admin panel applied. Nice, now it's looking better.</p>
<p>Day076: Started chapter about static files. To practise importing static files in django, I created second project called business_site.</p>
<p>Day077: Creating, collecting and finding (also using verbose).</p>
<p>Day078: Collecting static files using ManifestFilesStorage. Moreover, I've added logo file into app, but I can't load it into webpage.</p>
<p>Day079: Chapter about static files done! Now I have two logos: one in global app and different in reviews application.</p>
<p>Day080: Next chapter - forms. For today I've created subproject (I took it into gitignore file to keep my Bookr project clean) and created a big form file with many input types just to get to know how it works, how to write form.html files and learn about CSRF tokens.</p>
<p>Day081: Okay - yesterday I wrote first form example using HTML code. Now it's time to do the same easier way -> using Django forms class!</p>
<p>Day082: I created a form to search for books using title or contributor of the book using django (Python) code instead of HTML.</p>
<p>Day083: Today I was working on a subproject. Topic - Intermediate validation of forms and modelforms using clean method and cleaned_data.get(param).</p>
<p>Day084: Using knowledge how to create an ModelForm I created a modelform to add and update reviews for books and Publishers that are in my database.</p>
<p>Day085: Eighth chapter: sending files in Django. For today I've created next subproject where I can practise sending files into Django app using forms and saving them in my app directory. Moreover, I used library Pillow to overwrite width and height of images uploaded into Django server.</p>
<p>Day086: Eighth chapter done! I've created model form to upload books covers and books samples into django app. Moreover, if cover & sample exists, user can see or download it.</p>
<p>Day087: Ninth chapter: sessions & authentication. For today I've copied templates & endpoints from django admin module (like login, logout, change password or e-mail) and changed them to fit in my app.</p>
<p>Day088: Ninth chapter - done. I've created authentication function and added it to 'user_passes_test' decorator. Moreover, I've took some request.session informations and added it into a profile page.</p>
<p>Day089: Tenth chapter is going to teach me how to fit admin site into my project. For today I've created & overwrited logout page.</p>
<p>Day090: Today I was trying to add created django admin view - admin profile, but unfortunately got 404. I have to solve this.</p>
<p>Day091: Trying to solve yesterdays bug..</p>
<p>Day092: Still didn't find the solution.. Instead of this I've finished tenth episode. I will have to solve this later.</p>
<p>Day093: Eleventh chapter - tags & Class Based Views. Today I was reading about custom tags included in html files.</p>
<p>Day094: Second custom tag done. Moreover, my first Class-Based Views about CRUD were created! </p>
<p>Day095: Got some problem with custom tag.. It should list read books on profile page, but it shows second navbar instead.. Don't want to waste time, so I started next chapter - Django Rest Framework! For today I've created two fbv (than I deleted them) and two cbv - one about books, second about contributors.</p>
<p>Day096: DRF chapter - done. I learned how to create fbv, cbv, generate tokens, create serializers (and why should I use them) and routers.. Veeeeery interesting chapter.</p>
