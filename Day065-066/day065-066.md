For next two days (today&tomorrow) I'm going to do a Docker [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo&list=PL_U5mRW0SoP0FOrMdKQnQCO6CU0QpWiEz&index=2) for beginners from freeCodeCamp. Moreover, I'm going to write here some notes.

#### Day065

##### Getting started

What the containers are?

- Completely isolated environments,
- They can have their own processes or services
- They have separated network interfaces, their own mounts,
- They share the same OS
- They are lightweight,

Default OS for Docker is Linux.

The main purpose of Docker is to package and containerize applications to ship them and to run anywhere anytime as many times as you want.



Hardware Infrastructure -> OS -> Docker -> Libraries + Dependencies -> Application / Container
                                        -> Libraries + Dependencies -> Application / Container

How is it done?
```
docker run <image_name>
```

What is the difference between image & container?

Image:
- is a package or a template,
- it's used to create one or more containers

Containers:
- running instances of images,
- are isolated from each other,
- have their own environments and set of processes

##### Docker Commands

run - start a container
```
docker run <image_name>
```

ps - list containers
```
docker ps
docker ps -a    # lists all containers
```

stop a running container
```
docker stop <container_name> / <container_id>
```

rm - remove a container
```
docker rm <container_name>  # if we get a container name as an output - we're good
```

images - list images
```
docker images
```

rmi - remove images

You must stop & delete all containers that uses image you want to delete!
```
docker rmi <image_name>
```

pull - download an image
```
docker pull <image_name>
```

append a command
```
docker run ubuntu <command>

example:
docker run ubuntu sleep 5
```

exec - execute a command
```
docker exec <container_name> cat <command>

example:
docker exec distracted_mcclintock cat /etc/hosts
# this is printing the contents of the Etsy hosts file
```

run - attach and detach
```
docker run kodekloud/simple-webapp      # now you can't do anything in your terminal while the container is running

docker run -d kodekloud/simple-webapp

docker attach <first_few_characters_of_a_containers_id>
```

#### Day066

##### Labs

[Online course](https://kodekloud.com/p/docker-labs)

##### Run

<details>

<summary>run-tag</summary>

Run the latest version of Redis container
```
docker run redis
```

Run the exact version of Redis container
```
docker run redis:4.0
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>run-stdin</summary>

Run the container in interactive mode
```
docker run -i kodekloud/simple-prompt-docker
```

.. and add a pseudo terminal
```
docker run -it kodekloud/simple-prompt-docker
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>run-port mapping</summary>

If I want the users to access my app through port 80 on my Docker host, I could map port 80 of local host to port 5000 on the Docker container using the -p parameter.

```
docker run -p 80:5000 kodekloud/webapp
```

.. and they can go into my webapp using url:

http://192.168.1.5:80

</details>

<details>

<summary>run-volume mapping</summary>

This way your data will now be stored in the external volume. This will remain even if you delete the Docker container.

```
docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>inspect container</summary>

```
docker inspect <container_name_or_id>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>container logs</summary>

```
docker logs <container_name_or_id>
```

</details>


##### Environment variables

Let's say we have Flask app code like this:

```
import os
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

...
...

color = "red"

@app.route('/')
def main():
    print(color)
    return render_template('hello.html', color=color)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port="8000")
```

.. and we run command:

```
python3 app.py
```

We get some page with red background color. But what if we want to change the color?

That's right, we have to change some code.

It's a best practise to move such information out of the app code and say into an environment variable, like:

```
color = os.environ.get('APP_COLOR')
```

Now, to run the app, you can just type in terminal:

```
export APP_COLOR=blue; python3 app.py
```

Now, when you want to run the app using Docker container, just type:

```
docker run -e APP_COLOR=blue simple-webapp-color
```

Okay. But how to finf the env variable on running container?

Inspect the container using command:

```
docker inspect <container_name>

[
    {
        "Id": "some_id",
        "State": {
            "State": "some_state",
            "Running": "some_running"
        },
        
        "Mounts": [],
        "Config": {
            "Env": [
                "APP_COLOR=blue",    <-!!!!!!
                "LANG=C.UTF-8",
                "GPG_KEY=SOME_KEY",
                "PYTHON_VERSION=SOME_VERSION",
                "PYTHON_PIP_VERSION=SOME_VERSION"
            ],
            "Entrypoint": [
                "python",
                "app.py"
            ],
        }
    }
]

```


##### Images

How to create my own image?

Steps required in the right order:

If I want to set it up manually:

1. Operating system -> Ubuntu,
2. Update the source repositories using 'apt repo' command
3. Install dependencies using 'apt' command,
4. Install Python dependencies using pip command,
5. Copy source code to /opt folder,
6. Run the web server using "flask" command

Quick overview of creating your own image:

1. Create a Docker file named ```Dockerfile``` and write down the instructions for setting up your application in it 
(such as installing dependencies, where to copy the source code from and to, and what the entry point of the application
is, etc.)

```
FROM Ubuntu

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install python

RUN pip install flask
RUN pip install flask-mysql

COPY . /opt/source-code

ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/source-code/app.py flask run
```

2. Once done, build your image using the Docker build command and specify the Docker
file as input as well as a tag name for the image. This will create an image locally on your system.

```
docker build Dockerfile -t <image_name>
```

3. To make it available on the public Docker Hub register, run the Docker push command and specify the name if the image
you just created.

```
docker push <image_name>
```
