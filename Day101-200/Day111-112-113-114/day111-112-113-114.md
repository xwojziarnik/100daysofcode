Now I'm working on Word Parser App.

<p>Day111: Unfortunately - internet connection here is very weak, so I can't code here.. I'll try tomorrow.</p>
<p>Day112: Same problem there.. I can push only one little commit.. Tomorrow I'll get home and I'm going to rock this app!</p>
<p>Day113: Next shitty day - car issues. I'm done for today.</p>
<p>Day114: For today I've modified base.html and models in the app. Tomorrow I'll keep going.</p>
