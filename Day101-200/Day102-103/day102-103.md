Today I start reading a book about Docker. Next couple of days I'm going to do the exercises from that book for better 
understanding how Docker works and how can I containerize my apps using Docker.

Let the adventure begin!

<p>Day102: Today I've learned why Docker is necessary in IT. Moreover, I got to know that if you have app which has few
years and has millions lines of code you can containerize that using few commands and creating few docker files.</p>

<p>Day103: Welcome back on Mac Mini, where I can run Docker! Below you have 4 basic commands:</p>

- run -> to run the app in container,
- logs -> to see diary file of container,
- top -> to list running processes of container,
- inspect -> see details of container

<p> For today I've practised running containers, listing them, killing them and run container which is running in a 
background. Moreover, I can check it on localhost.</p>
