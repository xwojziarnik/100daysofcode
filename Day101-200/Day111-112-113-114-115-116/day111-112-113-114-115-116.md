Now I'm working on Word Parser App.

<p>Day111: Unfortunately - internet connection here is very weak, so I can't code here.. I'll try tomorrow.</p>
<p>Day112: Same problem there.. I can push only one little commit.. Tomorrow I'll get home and I'm going to rock this app!</p>
<p>Day113: Next shitty day - car issues. I'm done for today.</p>
<p>Day114: For today I've modified base.html and models in the app. Tomorrow I'll keep going.</p>
<p>Day115: Today a nice step: hard-coded three flashcards and listed them on subpage. Now I have to think how to implement displaying reverse of flashcard.</p>
<p>Day116: Changing plans -> instead of using Flask I'll do that app in Django. It's going to be better for being an admin. For today I've created an project and first app.</p>
