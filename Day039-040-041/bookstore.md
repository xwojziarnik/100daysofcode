I've got special challenge today. I couldn't decline it.

I have to increase my skills in testing and deploying apps using Docker.

First thought - write bookstore app once again. From scratch. Better version, included users app inside. 

So, there you have new [repo](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/bookstore).

For today (day039) I've created git repo, project, apps and db using MySQL Workbench.

Day040: Today I've hidden the app passwords, created a base template in main directory, dashboard template in Users app and first dashboard func. Everything is working well.

Day041: Still doing users app. Created login form, logout redirect, got one issue when I want to change my password -> than Django includes admin panel - I don't know why, but I have to solve it.
