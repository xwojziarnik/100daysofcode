For next two days (today&tomorrow) I'm going to do a Docker [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo&list=PL_U5mRW0SoP0FOrMdKQnQCO6CU0QpWiEz&index=2) for beginners from freeCodeCamp. Moreover, I'm going to write here some notes.

#### Day065

##### Getting started

What the containers are?

- Completely isolated environments,
- They can have their own processes or services
- They have separated network interfaces, their own mounts,
- They share the same OS
- They are lightweight,

Default OS for Docker is Linux.

The main purpose of Docker is to package and containerize applications to ship them and to run anywhere anytime as many times as you want.



Hardware Infrastructure -> OS -> Docker -> Libraries + Dependencies -> Application / Container
                                        -> Libraries + Dependencies -> Application / Container

How is it done?
```
docker run <image_name>
```

What is the difference between image & container?

Image:
- is a package or a template,
- it's used to create one or more containers

Containers:
- running instances of images,
- are isolated from each other,
- have their own environments and set of processes

##### Docker Commands

run - start a container
```
docker run <image_name>
```

ps - list containers
```
docker ps
docker ps -a    # lists all containers
```

stop a running container
```
docker stop <container_name> / <container_id>
```

rm - remove a container
```
docker rm <container_name>  # if we get a container name as an output - we're good
```

images - list images
```
docker images
```

rmi - remove images

You must stop & delete all containers that uses image you want to delete!
```
docker rmi <image_name>
```

pull - download an image
```
docker pull <image_name>
```

append a command
```
docker run ubuntu <command>

example:
docker run ubuntu sleep 5
```

exec - execute a command
```
docker exec <container_name> cat <command>

example:
docker exec distracted_mcclintock cat /etc/hosts
# this is printing the contents of the Etsy hosts file
```

run - attach and detach
```
docker run kodekloud/simple-webapp      # now you can't do anything in your terminal while the container is running

docker run -d kodekloud/simple-webapp

docker attach <first_few_characters_of_a_containers_id>
```
