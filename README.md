I've decided to join the #100daysofcode challenge.

I'll push here my code everyday for 100 days since today (25.04.2022). 
If you would like to read something more about this challenge, visit:

For this 100 days I would like to end my Udemy Python course. I did the 35% of course until today.

Next thing I'd like to learn in this challenge are two of Python frameworks:
DJANGO & FLASK

I'd be thankful for any feedback for my job.

01.08.2022: I've completed this challenge. Little summary - instead of finishing my Udemy course I've focussed on Web Development using frameworks like Django,
Flask or Sanic. I got to know more about API and created few apps, like:
- [LearnFlaskForPython](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/learnFlaskForPython) -> day 9-11,
- [TechWithTim-REST-API](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/TechWithTim-REST-API) -> day 12-15,
- [Django-Bookstore](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/django_bookstore), which you can see at [website](https:wojciechziarnik.pythonanywhere.com) -> day 20-26,
- [Django_Mysite](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/django_mysite) -> day 27-35,
- [AsyncRestApi](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/AsyncRestApi) -> day 49-50,
- [DockerFlaskNginxUwsgi](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/DockerFlaskNginxUwsgi) -> day 51-53,
- [FlaskCourseFCC](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/FlaskCourseFCC) -> day 55-64,
- [Bookr](https://github.com/xwojziarnik/Bookr) -> day 69-99,

Moreover, I've done MongoDB basic course at MongoDB Academy and Docker tutorial from FreeCodeCamp.

Now, I think that it would be stupid to stop coding day by day, so I keep going.
