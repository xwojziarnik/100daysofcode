I've decided to join the #100daysofcode challenge.

I'll push here my code everyday for 100 days since today. 
If you would like to read something more about this challenge, go to:

For this 100 days I would like to end my Udemy Python course. I did the 35% of course until today.

Next thing I'd like to learn in this challenge are two of Python frameworks:
DJANGO & FLASK

I'd be thankful for any feedback for my job.
